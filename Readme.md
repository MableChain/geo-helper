#GeoJson Helper

GeoJSON is a format for encoding a variety of geographic data structures.

In 2015, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), in conjunction with the original specification
authors, formed a [GeoJSON WG][1] to standardize GeoJSON. [RFC 7946][2] was published in August 2016 and is
the new standard specification of the GeoJSON format, replacing the [2008 GeoJSON specification.
